        <p style="font-size:1.2rem; opacity:0.9; margin-top:1rem;">The Second Maroon War (1795-1796)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">

        <p>In 1795, a new Governor arrived in Jamaica: the Earl of Balcarres. A man of ambition and military arrogance,
            he viewed the Maroons not as treaty partners but as a "dangerous imperium in imperio"—an empire within an
            empire.</p>

        <p>He was looking for a reason to crush them. In early July, he found it.</p>

        <h2>The Spark</h2>
        <p>Two Maroon men were accused of stealing hogs from a plantation. Instead of being tried by their own leaders
            (as the Treaty mandated), they were tried in Montego Bay. Their punishment was not just harsh; it was
            designed to humiliate.</p>

        </div>

        <p>This was the ultimate insult for free men. When they returned to Trelawny Town, the outrage was explosive.
            The Maroons demanded justice. Balcarres answered with martial law.</p>

        <h2>The Ambush of Colonel Sandford</h2>

        <p>In August 1795, Balcarres ordered his troops to march on Trelawny Town. The Maroons, knowing they could not
            defend the town against cannon fire, burned their own homes and retreated into the virtually impenetrable
            Cockpit Country.</p>

        <p>There, they turned the tables. Colonel Sandford, leading a massive column of over 1,500 men—including the
            elite 20th Light Dragoons and local Militia—marched into a narrow defile expecting an easy victory.</p>

        <!-- THE MASSIVE COLUMN -->

            <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #ccc; margin-top: 8px;">The British column, nearly half a mile long,
                marching into the trap.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Sandford made a fatal mistake. Arriving at the abandoned "New Town," he ignored orders to turn right onto
            Coote Bush Road. Instead, driven by arrogance, he marched straight ahead into the "Dragoon Hole"—the lowest
            point of the road.</p>

        <p>As the head of the column began to climb out of the hole, a "Tremendous Volley" erupted from the bushes. The
            Maroons, invisible in the green hell, decimated the officers first. <strong>Colonel Sandford fell
                instantly.</strong> Panic ensued. The massive force, trapped in the narrow road, could not maneuver. It
            was a massacre.</p>

        <h2>The Turning Point: Terror</h2>
        <p>For months, the Maroons held out against thousands of British troops. Colonels fell. Regiments were
            humiliated. The "Invisible Army" seemed invincible.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Desperate, Balcarres resorted to terror. In December 1795, he imported 100 ferocious bloodhounds and their
            handlers from Cuba. The threat of these dogs attacking Maroon families forced a painful decision: they
            agreed to negotiate a surrender, but only on the condition they would not be deported.</p>

        <h2>The Final Betrayal</h2>
        <p>General Walpole promised them they could stay in Jamaica. The Maroons laid down their arms. But Balcarres,
            furious at being humiliated, broke Walpole's word. Using a trivial deadline technicality, he arrested the
            Maroons and ordered their immediate deportation to Nova Scotia.</p>

        <!-- IMAGE: Occupation Plans -->
        <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; color: #aaa;">The Occupation</h2>
        <p>With the Maroons gone, the British wasted no time. They built a permanent barracks on the ruins of Trelawny
            Town to ensure no one would ever claim the land again.</p>
