        <h1>The Betrayal and the Conflict</h1>
        <p style="font-size:1.2rem; opacity:0.9; margin-top:1rem;">The Second Maroon War (1795-1796)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">

        <p>In 1795, a new Governor arrived in Jamaica: the Earl of Balcarres. A man of ambition and military arrogance,
            he viewed the Maroons not as treaty partners but as a "dangerous imperium in imperio"—an empire within an
            empire.</p>

        <p>He was looking for a reason to crush them. In early July, he found it.</p>

        <h2>The Spark</h2>
        <p>Two Maroon men were accused of stealing hogs from a plantation. Instead of being tried by their own leaders
            (as the Treaty mandated), they were tried in Montego Bay. Their punishment was not just harsh; it was
            designed to humiliate.</p>

        <div class="highlight-red">
            They were whipped by a slave driver.

            </p>
        </div>

        <p>This was the ultimate insult for free men. When they returned to Trelawny Town, the outrage was explosive.
            The Maroons demanded justice. Balcarres answered with martial law.</p>

        <h2>The Ambush</h2>
        <!-- IMAGE: Maroon Ambush -->
        <div style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; width: 45%; min-width: 300px;">
            <img src="Pictures/maroon-ambush.jpg" alt="Maroons lying in wait"
                style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid var(--gold-accent);">
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; color: #ccc; margin-top: 5px;">Maroons used the Cockpit terrain to ambush
                British columns.</p>
        </div>

        <p>In August 1795, Balcarres ordered his troops to march on Trelawny Town. The Maroons, knowing they could not
            defend the town against cannon fire, burned their own homes and retreated into the virtually impenetrable
            Cockpit Country.</p>

        <p>There, they turned the tables. Colonel Sandford, leading the elite 20th Light Dragoons, marched into a narrow
            defile expecting an easy victory. Instead, he met a wall of hidden fire. Sandford was killed instantly,
            along with many of his officers. The British retreated in panic.</p>

                regulars."</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Turning Point: Terror</h2>
        <p>For months, the Maroons held out against thousands of British troops. Colonels fell. Regiments were
            humiliated. The "Invisible Army" seemed invincible.</p>

                landscape of the war.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Desperate, Balcarres resorted to terror. In December 1795, he imported 100 ferocious bloodhounds and their
            handlers from Cuba. The threat of these dogs attacking Maroon families forced a painful decision: they
            agreed to negotiate a surrender, but only on the condition they would not be deported.</p>

        <h2>The Final Betrayal</h2>
        <p>General Walpole promised them they could stay in Jamaica. The Maroons laid down their arms. But Balcarres,
            furious at being humiliated, broke Walpole's word. Using a trivial deadline technicality, he arrested the
            Maroons and ordered their immediate deportation to Nova Scotia.</p>

        <!-- IMAGE: Occupation Plans -->
        <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; color: #aaa;">The Occupation</h2>
        <p>With the Maroons gone, the British wasted no time. They built a permanent barracks on the ruins of Trelawny
            Town to ensure no one would ever claim the land again.</p>
