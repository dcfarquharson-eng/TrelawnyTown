            The history of the Trelawny Maroons is not merely a story of escape from slavery; it is a story of
            nation-building in the face of impossible odds. Long before the American Revolution, the Maroons of Jamaica
            had forced the British Empire to its knees.

                            In the rugged limestone hills of the Cockpit Country—a terrain so treacherous that British
                            soldiers could barely traverse it—a community of escaped Africans forged a new society.
                        </p>

                            Led by the brilliant strategist <strong>Cudjoe</strong>, the Leeward Maroons waged an
                            80-year war against the colonial militia. They used the land as a weapon, turning the
                            Cockpit Country into an impenetrable fortress.

                        By 1738, the British realized they could not win militarily. Governor Edward Trelawny authorized
                        a peace treaty—the first of its kind in the Caribbean.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Signed by Captain Cudjoe and British officers, it was a victory, but one that came with a heavy
                        price. This agreement granted them freedom but bound them to the colonial government in ways
                        that would echo through history.

                            willing to return to their said masters and owners, with full pardon and indemnity from
                            their said masters or owners for what is past; provided always, that, if they are not
                            willing to return, they shall remain in subjection to Captain Cudjoe and in friendship with
                            us, according to the form and tenor of this treaty.</li>

                        <li><strong>III.</strong> That they shall enjoy and possess, for themselves and posterity for
                            ever, all the lands situate and lying between Trelawney Town and the Cockpits, to the amount
                            of fifteen hundred acres, bearing Northwest from the said Trelawney Town.</li>

                        <li><strong>IV.</strong> That they shall have liberty to plant the said lands with coffee,

                            expose their goods to sale, for a licence to vend the same.</li>

                            subjection to him, shall all live together within the bounds of Trelawney Town, and that

                            they submit to the same terms of accommodation granted to Captain Cudjoe, and his
                            successors.</li>

                            notice given, immediately repair to any place the Governor for the time being shall appoint,
                            in order to repel the said invaders with his or their utmost force, and to submit to the
                            orders of the Commander in Chief on that occasion.</li>

                        <li><strong>VIII.</strong> That if any white man shall do any manner of injury to Captain
                            Cudjoe, his successors, or any of his or their people, they shall apply to any commanding
                            officer or magistrate in the neighbourhood for justice; and in case Captain Cudjoe, or any

                            or the Commander in Chief for the time being, every year, if thereunto required.</li>

                        <li><strong>XII.</strong> That Captain Cudjoe, during his life, and the captains succeeding him,
                            shall have full power to inflict any punishment they think proper for crimes committed by
                            their men among themselves, death only excepted; in which case, if the captain thinks they
                            deserve death, he shall be obliged to bring them before any justice of the peace, who shall
                            order proceedings on their trial equal to those of other free Negroes.</li>

                        <li><strong>XIII.</strong> That Captain Cudjoe, with his people, shall cut, clear, and keep
                            open, large and convenient roads from Trelawney Town to Westmorland and St. James's, and if
                            possible to St. Elizabeth's.</li>

                        <li><strong>XIV.</strong> That two white men, to be nominated by the Governor or Commander in
                            Chief for the time being, shall constantly live and reside with Captain Cudjoe and his
                            successors, in order to maintain a friendly correspondence with the inhabitants of this
                            island.</li>

                    For over 50 years, Trelawny Town flourished. It became the largest Maroon settlement, a bustling
                    community of 600 people living in relative peace. They farmed, traded at local markets, and built a
                    unique culture that blended African traditions with the realities of the Jamaican interior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But as the town grew, so did the envy of the neighboring planters—and the anxiety of the British
                    administration. The "peace" was fragile. The colonial government, terrified by the Haitian
                    Revolution next door, began to look for any excuse to dismantle Maroon autonomy.
