            The history of the Trelawny Maroons is not merely a story of escape from slavery; it is a story of
            nation-building in the face of impossible odds. Long before the American Revolution, the Maroons of Jamaica
            had forced the British Empire to its knees.

                            In the rugged limestone hills of the Cockpit Country—a terrain so treacherous that British
                            soldiers could barely traverse it—a community of escaped Africans forged a new society.

                        <p>
                            Led by the brilliant strategist <strong>Cudjoe</strong>, the Leeward Maroons waged an
                            80-year war against the colonial militia. They used the land as a weapon, turning the
                            Cockpit Country into an impenetrable fortress.

                        By 1738, the British realized they could not win militarily. Governor Edward Trelawny authorized
                        a peace treaty—the first of its kind in the Caribbean.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Signed by Captain Cudjoe and British officers, it was a victory, but one that came with a heavy
                        price. This agreement granted them freedom but bound them to the colonial government in ways
                        that would echo through history.

                    For over 50 years, Trelawny Town flourished. It became the largest Maroon settlement, a bustling
                    community of 600 people living in relative peace. They farmed, traded at local markets, and built a
                    unique culture that blended African traditions with the realities of the Jamaican interior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But as the town grew, so did the envy of the neighboring planters—and the anxiety of the British
                    administration. The "peace" was fragile. The colonial government, terrified by the Haitian
                    Revolution next door, began to look for any excuse to dismantle Maroon autonomy.
