                        The history of the Trelawny Maroons is not merely a story of escape from slavery — it is a story
                        of
                        nation-building in the face of impossible odds. For over 80 years, they fought, survived, and
                        built
                        a free society deep in the mountains of Jamaica.

                            In the rugged limestone hills of the Cockpit Country — a terrain so treacherous that British
                            soldiers could barely traverse it — a community of escaped Africans forged a new society.
                            These were the Leeward Maroons, descendants of enslaved Africans who had escaped Spanish
                            plantations
                            when the British conquered Jamaica in 1655.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Led by the brilliant strategist <strong>Cudjoe</strong> (also known as Kojo), and supported
                            by
                            his brothers <strong>Accompong</strong> and <strong>Johnny</strong>, and his sister
                            <strong>Nanny</strong> — the legendary Windward Maroon Queen — they waged an 80-year war
                            against
                            the colonial militia. They used the land as a weapon, turning the Cockpit Country into an
                            impenetrable fortress of limestone sinkholes, dense jungle, and hidden pathways known only
                            to them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            British expeditions sent to crush them returned shattered. Entire regiments were ambushed,
                            their
                            officers killed, their formations broken. The Maroons fired from invisible positions,
                            vanished
                            into the forest, and struck again miles away. Jamaica's plantation economy was in crisis.

                        By 1738, the British Empire admitted what few empires ever do — that they could not win.
                        Governor Edward Trelawny authorized a peace treaty, the first of its kind in the Caribbean.

                            After 80 years of warfare, the Crown was forced to negotiate with the people it had tried to
                            enslave.
                            Signed at a place now known as <strong>Cudjoe's Town</strong> (later renamed Trelawny Town),
                            the treaty granted the Maroons <strong>1,500 acres of land</strong>, the right to
                            self-governance,
                            their own judicial system, and the freedom to trade in Jamaican markets. Cudjoe was formally
                            recognized with the rank of <strong>Colonel</strong> by the British Crown.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was a victory — but one that came with a heavy price. The treaty bound the Maroons to
                            assist
                            the British in suppressing future slave rebellions and returning escaped slaves. This clause
                            would
                            haunt their legacy and create a painful moral tension that historians still debate today.

                        For over 50 years after the treaty, Trelawny Town flourished as the largest Maroon settlement
                        in Jamaica — a community of 600 free people who farmed, traded, and governed themselves.

                            Trelawny Town became the largest Maroon settlement in Jamaica — a bustling community of
                            approximately
                            <strong>600 people</strong> living in relative peace. They farmed fertile mountain plots,
                            raised
                            livestock, and traded produce at markets in Montego Bay and surrounding parishes. Their
                            unique
                            culture blended Akan traditions from West Africa with the realities of the Jamaican
                            interior.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Maroons maintained their own <strong>Council of Elders</strong>, their own military
                            structure,
                            and their own spiritual practices. They were, in every meaningful sense, a sovereign people
                            operating
                            within — but apart from — the British colonial system.

                            But as the town grew, so did the envy of neighboring planters and the anxiety of the British
                            administration. The <strong>Haitian Revolution of 1791</strong> — in which enslaved people
                            overthrew
                            their French masters — sent shockwaves through every plantation society in the region.
                            Jamaica's
                            colonial government, terrified by what they saw next door, began to look for any excuse to
                            dismantle Maroon autonomy once and for all.
