            The Trelawny Town Maroons were not merely escaped slaves — they were a sovereign nation who held the British
            Empire at bay for nearly a century. Below is their story, told in four chapters. Click any section to read

                    The history of the Trelawny Maroons is not merely a story of escape from slavery — it is a story of
                    nation-building in the face of impossible odds. For over 80 years, they fought, survived, and built
                    a free society deep in the mountains of Jamaica.

                <p>
                    Born from the ashes of Spanish Jamaica, these descendants of enslaved Africans refused to accept
                    bondage. They fled into the interior, forged communities in the mountains, and built a resistance
                    movement that the British Empire could not crush. Their story is one of the most remarkable in
                    the history of the Western Hemisphere.

                    In the rugged limestone hills of the Cockpit Country — a terrain so treacherous that British
                    soldiers could barely traverse it — a community of escaped Africans forged a new society.
                    These were the Leeward Maroons, descendants of enslaved Africans who had escaped Spanish plantations
                    when the British conquered Jamaica in 1655.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Led by the brilliant strategist <strong>Cudjoe</strong> (also known as Kojo), and supported by
                    his brothers <strong>Accompong</strong> and <strong>Johnny</strong>, and his sister
                    <strong>Nanny</strong> — the legendary Windward Maroon Queen — they waged an 80-year war against
                    the colonial militia. They used the land as a weapon, turning the Cockpit Country into an
                    impenetrable fortress of limestone sinkholes, dense jungle, and hidden pathways known only to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    British expeditions sent to crush them returned shattered. Entire regiments were ambushed, their
                    officers killed, their formations broken. The Maroons fired from invisible positions, vanished
                    into the forest, and struck again miles away. Jamaica's plantation economy was in crisis.

                        By 1738, the British Empire admitted what few empires ever do — that they could not win.
                        Governor Edward Trelawny authorized a peace treaty, the first of its kind in the Caribbean.

                    After 80 years of warfare, the Crown was forced to negotiate with the people it had tried to
                    enslave.
                    Signed at a place now known as <strong>Cudjoe's Town</strong> (later renamed Trelawny Town),
                    the treaty granted the Maroons <strong>1,500 acres of land</strong>, the right to self-governance,
                    their own judicial system, and the freedom to trade in Jamaican markets. Cudjoe was formally
                    recognized with the rank of <strong>Colonel</strong> by the British Crown.

                <p>
                    It was a victory — but one that came with a heavy price. The treaty bound the Maroons to assist
                    the British in suppressing future slave rebellions and returning escaped slaves. This clause would
                    haunt their legacy and create a painful moral tension that historians still debate today.

                        For over 50 years after the treaty, Trelawny Town flourished as the largest Maroon settlement
                        in Jamaica — a community of 600 free people who farmed, traded, and governed themselves.

                <p>
                    Trelawny Town became the largest Maroon settlement in Jamaica — a bustling community of
                    approximately
                    <strong>600 people</strong> living in relative peace. They farmed fertile mountain plots, raised
                    livestock, and traded produce at markets in Montego Bay and surrounding parishes. Their unique
                    culture blended Akan traditions from West Africa with the realities of the Jamaican interior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Maroons maintained their own <strong>Council of Elders</strong>, their own military structure,
                    and their own spiritual practices. They were, in every meaningful sense, a sovereign people
                    operating
                    within — but apart from — the British colonial system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But as the town grew, so did the envy of neighboring planters and the anxiety of the British
                    administration. The <strong>Haitian Revolution of 1791</strong> — in which enslaved people overthrew
                    their French masters — sent shockwaves through every plantation society in the region. Jamaica's
                    colonial government, terrified by what they saw next door, began to look for any excuse to
                    dismantle Maroon autonomy once and for all.
