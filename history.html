        <p>The history of the Trelawny Maroons is not merely a story of escape from slavery; it is a story of
            nation-building in the face of impossible odds. Long before the American Revolution, the Maroons of Jamaica
            had forced the British Empire to its knees.</p>

        <h2>The Leeward Maroons</h2>
        <p>In the rugged limestone hills of the Cockpit Country—a terrain so treacherous that British soldiers could
            barely traverse it—a community of escaped Africans forged a new society. Led by the brilliant strategist
            Cudjoe, the Leeward Maroons waged an 80-year war against the colonial militia.</p>

        <div class="quote-box">
            "They were not merely runaways. They were soldiers, strategists, and free men who refused to be conquered."

            <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #ccc; margin-top: 10px; font-style: italic;">The natural fortress of the
                Cockpit Country, where British artillery could not reach.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Treaty of 1738</h2>
        <p>By 1738, the British realized they could not win militarily. Governor Edward Trelawny authorized a peace
            treaty—the first of its kind in the Caribbean. Signed by Captain Cudjoe and British officers, it granted the
            Maroons:</p>

                style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid var(--gold-accent); border-radius: 4px;">
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; color: #ccc; margin-top: 5px; text-align: center;">Col. Guthrie & Capt. Cudjoe
                exchange hats in peace (1738).</p>
        </div>

        <ul style="font-size:1.1rem; line-height:1.8; margin-bottom:2rem;">
            <li><strong>Full Freedom and Liberty</strong> for themselves and their descendants forever.</li>
            <li><strong>1,500 Acres of Land</strong> in Trelawny Town.</li>
            <li><strong>The Right to Self-Governance</strong> under their own chiefs (with slight British oversight).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p style="clear: both;">However, this treaty came with a heavy price: the Maroons were required to return future
            runaways to the
            plantations. This "Blood Oath" would create a complex and painful relationship with the enslaved population
            associated with them, a tension that would echo through history.</p>

        <h2>The Golden Age (1739-1795)</h2>
        <p>For over 50 years, Trelawny Town flourished. It became the largest Maroon settlement, a bustling community of
            600 people living in relative peace. But as the town grew, so did the envy of the neighboring planters—and
            the anxiety of the British administration.</p>

        <p>The "peace" was fragile. The colonial government, terrified by the Haitian Revolution next door, began to
            look for any excuse to dismantle Maroon autonomy. In 1795, they found one.</p>
