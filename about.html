            <h2>Four Decades of Discovery</h2>
            <p>
                This website stands as the culmination of over <strong>40 years of meticulous research</strong> into the
                history of the Trelawny Town Maroons. For too long, the narrative of the Maroons has been filtered
                through
                the eyes of colonial oppressors—governors, military officers, and plantation owners. Our mission has
                been to
                peel back layers of colonial bias to reveal the truth about a free people who maintained their
                Identity
                in the face of the British Empire.
            </p>

                        Over 40 years, our library evolved from physical rare books to digitized PDFs —
                        and today, it is powered by five local AI models through a RAG system that can
                        interrogate over 2,500 volumes simultaneously. The tools have changed.

            <h2>Correcting the Record</h2>
            <p>
                History is not merely a collection of dates; it is a battle for memory. As Nina Simone said,
                <em>"There's no
                    excuse for the young people not knowing who the heroes and heroines are or were."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Our research has uncovered truths that challenge established narratives. We have located the exact sites
                where
                both Maroon treaties were signed. We have identified the true location of "Petty River Bottom" and
                "Guthrie
                Defile." We have traced the history of "Dragoon Hole" and how "Gun Hill" got its name.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most importantly, we have documented the <strong>final resting places of Maroon leaders</strong> and
                detailed
                the military barracks and estates like Samuel Vaughn's and Kamure's. We have reconstructed the "Mock"
                trial in
                Jamaica and the subsequent legal battles in England that sealed the fate of the Trelawny Maroons.

            <h2>A Living Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                This project is not just about the past; it is about the living memory of the Maroon people. We have
                collected
                <strong>oral histories</strong> to supplement the written record, ensuring that the voices of the
                ancestors
                speak as loudly as the ink on colonial paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the rugged limestone cliffs of the Cockpit Country to the frozen shores of Nova Scotia and the
                coast of
                Sierra Leone, we have pieced together the fragmented story of the 1795 War and the betrayal that led to
                the exile
                of an entire community. We present this work to honor Captain Leonard Parkinson, Montague James, and the
                hundreds
                of men, women, and children who fought for their freedom.
